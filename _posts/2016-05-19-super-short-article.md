[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) is an open source project that aims to create a free, editable map of the world. It's like Wikipedia, but for maps.

As part of my Data Visualization course at IDC School of Design, my classmates and I went to Galleria and Central Avenue in Hirandandani, Powai, and marked some places on the map. This article documents which places we went to and what we marked.
