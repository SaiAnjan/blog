### The Problem  
Public data exists, but few people use it to make decisions because :
- It is not clear if it's free to use.
- Data exists in silos, doesn't talk to each other.
- Expensive to subscribe to.
- Formats like PDF that are not directly usable.

### The Solution  
[How India Lives](http://howindialives.com/)  
NLP based search engine anyone can use without prior knowledge of existing data.
- Single database
- Searchable and comparable
- Visualized
