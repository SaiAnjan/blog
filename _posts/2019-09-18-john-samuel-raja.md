### How India Lives

#### The Problem  
Public data exists, but few people use it to make decisions because :
- It is not clear if it's free to use.
- Data exists in silos, doesn't talk to each other.
- Expensive to subscribe to.
- Formats like PDF that are not directly usable.

#### The Solution  
[How India Lives](http://howindialives.com/)  
NLP based search engine anyone can use without prior knowledge of existing data.
- Single database
- Searchable and comparable
- Visualized

#### Data that is easily accessible
- [data.gov.in](data.gov.in)
- [indiabudgets.nic.in](indiabudgets.nic.in)
- [censusindia.gov.in](censusindia.gov.in)

#### Data that should be free, but is charged
- Survey of India - there is a monopoly for maps in India (but some are free)
- IMD weather data

### Why is this useful?

#### Answering business problems
Example: a diaper maker wants to find out where the market is concentrated. This involves finding out where fertility rates are high, but they want people who can afford diapers. So they can look at places with high number of births in private hospitals and focus their efforts there.

#### Data journalism
Example: How was Gurgaon built? Did DLF get a disproportionate number of projects under a specific government? Did DLF really *build* Gurgaon?

### Data Ethics

#### What if Pepsi wants to sell water?
Pepsico wants to identify areas that don't have drinking water and sell drinking water there.
