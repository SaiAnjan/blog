#### The Problem  
Public data exists, but few people use it to make decisions because :
- It is not clear if it's free to use.
- Data exists in silos, doesn't talk to each other.
- Expensive to subscribe to.
- Formats like PDF that are not directly usable.

#### The Solution  
[How India Lives](http://howindialives.com/)  
NLP based search engine anyone can use without prior knowledge of existing data.
- Single database
- Searchable and comparable
- Visualized

#### Data that is easily accessible
- [data.gov.in](data.gov.in)
- [indiabudgets.nic.in](indiabudgets.nic.in)
- [censusindia.gov.in](censusindia.gov.in)

#### Data that should be free, but is charged
- Survey of India - there is a monopoly for maps in India (but some are free)
- IMD weather data

### Why is this useful?

#### Answering business problems
Example: a diaper maker wants to find out where the market is concentrated.
