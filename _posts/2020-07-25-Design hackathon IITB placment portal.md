## Brief of the work

So, if you already know me I'v currently graduated but no job. But in this scenario I've got some pending tasks from Uni to complete. Right now the biggest in this pipeline is the re-vamp of placement portal and honestly I actually regret for taking up this work. I was told that I'll be paid but let's wait for pratik to keep his word. Anyways the goal is to bring the portal design to a step where anyone can pick up this workand complete it, preferably juniors.

To start with I'll give you an idea of the current status of the design work. There are three important actors on this portal. Student, Recruiter, Co-ordinator(IPT member).

## Student

So this is the jobs view for a student profile. The left nav contains all the tabs for navigation. When you open the 'Jobs' tab it shows you the list of jobs like a regular list but in cards. Each job card cotains the company name(which you can click and look at the company page), job title, Job type(Metatag, which you can click and filter the jobs with that metatag), a short desc about the job because a little short desc wouldn't hurt, Location of the job(Same, filter with that location), Eligible stamp.

On the top there are 2 filters, well actually one 'view by' and the other is 'list by'. The view filter contains 4 filters:
1. Time
2. Alphabetical
3. Job Type
4. Company

This is the view filter I would want as a student looking for jobs in the uni placements. 

Then I started with the filters for 'List by':
1. IT/Software
2. Design
3. Business

So now what are the filters the students need while finding jobs. Let's see...

I'm looking for jobs obviously in the field I'm stdying in i.e., UG Department, Masters specialisation, Research specialisation. I'm not sure how many Ph.D studetns use portal much but looking at UG and PG folks I should look at kind of role keywords for each discipline:

1. Design - Design
2. Computer science - IT/Software

### But after clicking a job card it basically opens the job page:
