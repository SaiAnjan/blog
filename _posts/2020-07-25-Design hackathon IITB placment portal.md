## Design hackathon

So, if you already know me I'v currently graduated but no job. But in this scenario I've got some pending tasks from Uni to complete. Right now the biggest in this pipeline is the re-vamp of placement portal and honestly I actually regret for taking up this work. I was told that I'll be paid but let's wait for pratik to keep his word. Anyways the goal is to bring the portal design to a step where anyone can pick up this workand complete it, preferably juniors.

To start with I'll give you an idea of the current status of the design work. There are three important actors on this portal. Student, Recruiter, Co-ordinator(IPT member).
