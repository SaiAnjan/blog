## IDC Placement scenario

IDC has the following stength of students 

Batch/Discipline | No of students
--- | --- 
Animation Design | 12
Product Design | 12
Interaction Design | 12+4(Dual degree)
Communication Design | 12+4(Dual degree)
Mobility & vehicle Design | 12
Total M.Des | 70
B.Des | 30

Managing 100 students at once where masters have a different deadlines and bachelors have deadlines, it becomes tough for one coordinator. Having one person in touch with all the master students and other student with the bachelor students helps to disseminate news & updates very easily. 
> We need coordinators to represent B.Des (30 People) and M.des. (70 People)

Master students have already done graduation in a different discipline are looking for a career in design from the above said disciplines. So they need offers from relavant industries. Especially animation department has not seen relavant careers since psat few years. There are several reasons to this, but the one area IPT can intervene is the company scouting & pitching. Before their 3rd semester of masters students are required to do an summer internship of 2 months. During this period students intern with core companies i.e, animation studios, indie cartoon studios, design agencies priamrily focussed on animation etc., This provides several new connects, then there is alumni contacts, IPT company database.
> But to pitch to companies like these we need an dedicated coordinatior from aniamtion background itself.

Next, When it comes to IDC most of the companies are open for UI/UX roles. While this is good career path for streams like Interaction design, Product design and Communication design students need a different set of comapnies and studios for placements. So we need coordinators from M.Des who belong to different disciplines(Interaction, Product, Communiaction). Streams like Animation, PD and MVD where companies are very difficult to bring in, we will be needing the coordinators from that stream to help out. And we need people focused on that as well which means they have connects from these relavant industries and can pitch to companies for inviting.
> We ned 3 M.Des representatives from Interaction, Product, Communication and MVD.

B.Des scenario, Sem Ex, different career paths, student interests
> We need one coordinator to represent B.Des because of the different deadlines and timetable.

### Few bonus responsibilities

Since the design recruitement is very different from engineering and business. Following are the extra responsibilities that the placement coordinators have to take care:

1. Design brochure, website for IDC(Prefereably someone from Interaction or Communication)
2. Apart from resumes, which is probably the only form of verification they need to do. We need to look after the portfolios as well. The portfolio verification is better done when there are team members from different discplines.
3. Since this semester is gonna be an online one that brings on more challenges and I think more hands in deck will be helpful
4. Having 5 IDC coordinators also helps in pitiching to comapnies who are primarily coming for engineering recruitment
